# MNIST Digit-Classifier using Deep Learning

The MNIST digit classifier project is a classic example of applying deep learning techniques to image recognition tasks. MNIST stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, which is a large collection of handwritten digits commonly used for training various machine learning algorithms. In my project, A deep learning model is trained on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits into their respective categories (0 through 9). The dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits, each labeled with the corresponding digit it represents.

The project involves several key steps:

>>>Data preprocessing
>>Model architecture
>>>Training
>>>Evaluation
>>>Deployment

Overall, the MNIST digit classifier project demonstrates the power of deep learning in recognizing and classifying handwritten digits with high accuracy....
